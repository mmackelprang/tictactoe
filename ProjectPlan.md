## Detailed Implementation Plan for Network Multiplayer & Advanced AI

### Phase 1: Web Application Infrastructure

**Objective**: Convert the console application to a web-based application with real-time capabilities.

**Technical Stack**:
- ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web Application
- Blazor Server for interactive UI (or Razor Pages with JavaScript)
- SignalR for real-time bidirectional communication
- Bootstrap or modern CSS framework for responsive design

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create new ASP.NET Core Web Application project
2. Set up SignalR hub for game communication
3. Port existing game logic (Board, Player, GameController) to be web-compatible
4. Create web-based game board UI component
5. Implement client-side interaction handlers
6. Add session management and user tracking

**File Structure**:
```
TicTacToe.Web/
â”œâ”€â”€ Hubs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameHub.cs              # SignalR hub for real-time communication
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameService.cs          # Manages multiple game instances
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LobbyService.cs         # Manages connected users and matchmaking

    â””â”€â”€ images/                 # Assets
```

### Phase 2: Network Multiplayer Features

**Game Lobby System**:
- Display all connected users with status (Available, In Game, etc.)
- Show active games and allow spectating
- Implement game invitation system
- Handle user connections and disconnections gracefully

**SignalR Hub Methods**:
```csharp
// Server to Client
- OnUserConnected(string userId, string username)
- OnUserDisconnected(string userId)
- OnGameInvitation(string fromUserId, string gameId)
- OnGameStarted(GameState gameState)
- OnMoveMade(int row, int col, char mark)
- OnGameEnded(string winnerId, string reason)
- OnLobbyUpdated(List<ConnectedUser> users)

// Client to Server
- JoinLobby(string username)
- LeaveLobby()
- InvitePlayer(string targetUserId)
- AcceptInvitation(string gameId)
- DeclineInvitation(string gameId)
- StartGameWithAI(int difficulty)
- MakeMove(string gameId, int row, int col)
- LeaveGame(string gameId)
```

**Game Session Management**:
- Support multiple concurrent games on the server
- Maintain game state in memory (or Redis for scalability)
- Handle player timeouts and disconnections
- Implement reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Persist game history (optional)

**Matchmaking Logic**:
```
1. User joins lobby â†’ Receives list of available players
2. User selects opponent or chooses AI
3. If opponent selected:
   a. Send invitation to opponent
   b. Wait for acceptance/decline
   c. On acceptance, create game session
4. If AI selected:
   a. Create game session immediately
   b. Assign AI player to game
5. Start game and sync initial state to both clients
6. Handle moves via SignalR
7. Validate moves server-side
8. Broadcast move results to both players
9. Check win/draw conditions
10. End game and return players to lobby
```

### Phase 3: Advanced AI Implementation

**Minimax Algorithm**:
```csharp
public class MinimaxAIPlayer : Player
{
    private readonly int _maxDepth;
    private readonly bool _useAlphaBeta;
    
    public MinimaxAIPlayer(char mark, string name, int maxDepth, bool useAlphaBeta) 
        : base(mark, name)
    {
        _maxDepth = maxDepth;
        _useAlphaBeta = useAlphaBeta;
    }
    
    public override (int row, int col) GetMove(Board board)
    {
        if (_useAlphaBeta)
            return GetBestMoveWithAlphaBeta(board);
        else
            return GetBestMoveWithMinimax(board);
    }
    
    private (int row, int col) GetBestMoveWithMinimax(Board board)
    {
        // Implementation details below
    }
    
    private (int row, int col) GetBestMoveWithAlphaBeta(Board board)
    {
        // Implementation with alpha-beta pruning
    }
    
    private int Minimax(Board board, int depth, bool isMaximizing)
    {
        // Check terminal states
        if (board.CheckWin(Mark)) return 10 - depth;
        if (board.CheckWin(OpponentMark)) return depth - 10;
        if (board.IsFull()) return 0;
        if (depth >= _maxDepth) return EvaluatePosition(board);
        
        // Recursive minimax logic
    }
    
    private int MinimaxWithAlphaBeta(Board board, int depth, int alpha, int beta, bool isMaximizing)
    {
        // Similar to Minimax but with pruning
    }
    
    private int EvaluatePosition(Board board)
    {
        // Heuristic evaluation for non-terminal states
        // Count potential winning lines, central control, etc.
    }
}
```

**AI Difficulty Levels**:
- **Easy**: Current implementation (Win > Block > Random)
- **Medium**: Minimax with depth limit of 3-4 moves
- **Hard**: Full minimax with alpha-beta pruning (optimal play)
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts difficulty based on player performance (future)

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Implement move ordering (check center and corners first)
- Use transposition tables to cache evaluated positions
- Limit search depth for larger boards (5x5+)
- Consider iterative deepening for time-limited moves
- Pre-compute symmetrical positions to reduce search space

**AI Strategy Considerations**:
- For 3x3 boards: Perfect play is achievable
- For larger boards: Use depth-limited search with heuristics
- Heuristic evaluation: Center control, line potential, blocking opportunities
- Opening book: Pre-defined strong opening moves
- Endgame optimization: Exact calculation when few moves remain

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

**Testing Requirements**:
1. Unit tests for AI algorithms
   - Minimax returns optimal moves
   - Alpha-beta pruning produces same results as minimax
   - Performance benchmarks for various board sizes

2. Integration tests for web components
   - SignalR hub communication
   - Game state synchronization
   - User connection/disconnection handling

3. End-to-end tests
   - Complete game flow: lobby â†’ game â†’ completion
   - Multiple concurrent games
   - AI vs Human gameplay
   - Human vs Human over network

4. Load testing
   - Server capacity with many concurrent games
   - SignalR connection limits
   - Response time under load

**Deployment Considerations**:
- Configure CORS for SignalR
- Set up HTTPS for production
- Configure connection timeouts
- Implement rate limiting
- Add logging and monitoring
- Consider scalability (load balancing, Redis backplane for SignalR)

### Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements

**UI/UX Features**:
- Animated piece placement
- Sound effects for moves
- Game timer/move timer
- Chat functionality between players
- Player profiles and statistics
